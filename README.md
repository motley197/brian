The Lora(wan) project started in June 2023 by Nick Outram and Chris Tipney.

The idea is to connect to sensors and controls in a remote location using Lora and/or Lorawan.

First project is to monitor growing conditions for plants and control their environment.

This repo is somewhere to drop all our links, documents and ideas - maybe some code as well!
