# brian

The Lora(wan) project started in June 2023 by Nick Outram and Chris Tipney.

The idea is to connect to sensors and controls in a remote location using Lora and/or Lorawan.

First project is to monitor growing conditions for plants and control their environment.

This repo is somewhere to drop all our links, documents and ideas - maybe some code as well!


# Why Brian?

Well, consider this is a homage to four Great British Brian's:

* Brian of Nazareth (Monty Python's Life of Brian)
* Brian Blessed (for performances in Black Adder and for services to swearing)
* Brian May (guitarist for Queen)
* Brian the Snail (from the legendary, and somewhat surreal children's TV programme, "The Magic Roundabout").

If Douglas Adams had a middle name of Brian, we would include him too, but he doesn't as far as I know. Maybe the next repository will be called Douglas.
