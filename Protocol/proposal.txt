Outline ideas for communications protocol
-----------------------------------------

The nodes fall into three categories:
	(1) Base
	(2) Repeater
	(3) End

Each node has the same hardware:
	(1) Rpi Pico W
	(2) SD card slot
	(3) Grove sockets for attaching sensors and relays
	(4) LCD screen for monitoring (optional)
	(5) 4 DIP switches for ID configuration

Base Node
---------
The system has only one of these.
Functions:
	(1) Maintain data storage
	(2) Retrieve data readings from the end nodes
	(3) Send commands to the end nodes

Repeater Node
-------------
The system has a variable number of these.
Functions:
	(1) Listen to all communications
	(2) Re-transmit data packets when required
	(3) Otherwise save energy

End Node
--------
The system has a variable nmber of these.
Functions:
	(1) Collect sensor data and store locally
	(2) Transmit sensor data whan requested
	(3) Respond to action data packets and execute the action
	(4) Send caution/warning messages unprompted in certain circumstances
	(5) Otherwise save energy

Data Packets
------------
At the core of the system is the sending and receiving of 'packets' of data.

It's probably easier if these packets are of a fixed size with certain positions within the
packet having a specific meaning.

There is an overhead to establishing a 'session' between nodes so once established this should 
persist for a pre-set time before being reset.

A simple system of handshaking is needed to establish a session between nodes. The the session is
awarded a code which both nodes (including repeater when needed) use to confirm receipt of a valid 
data packet.

Data packets can contain data for the following:
	(1) Sensor data
	(2) Commands
	(3) Watchdog function (healthcheck)
	(4) Session reset
